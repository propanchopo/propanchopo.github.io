    <p>Shiba Inu has seen significant price increases in recent days, with its value rising to $0.00002169 at one point. This represents a breakthrough for the cryptocurrency, which had been relatively calm in terms of price action in recent months.

The surge in SHIB's price has led to increased discussions among large companies and investors are advised to wait for the strong upward narrative to subside slightly before considering a potential all-time high.

SHIB's on-chain activity has increased compared to other alternative cryptocurrencies and meme coins, with its social dominance, trading volume, and whale transactions reaching new highs within a 10-week timeframe.

Shiba Inu's developer has expressed enthusiasm about the cryptocurrency's recent price increase, saying "Go SHIB Go" as it continues to gain traction due to positive market movements and growing interest in Shiba Inu's environmental system.

The trading volume of SHIB has reached an impressive $1.46 billion in 24 hours, with its price breaking past $0.0000195 and continuing to rise.

There are also rumors about a potential ETF approval for Shiba Inu, which could potentially lead to a 2200% rally in the cryptocurrency's price over the next 10 days.</p>

    <h2 id="near">NEAR</h2>
    <p>I'll summarize the provided text while maintaining the original sentiment.

The protocol has seen significant growth, with a 50% increase in price between September 6 and 24, rising from $3.41 to $5.36. This uptick was driven by increasing user activity, network upgrades, and external market influences.

A recent price prediction for NEAR Protocol shows that it's bullish and set for another leg up in the near term, potentially reaching $6.00 or more. Expert Sheldon The Sniper believes Solana is "ready to go again," predicting a potential price upshift from its current level.

The successful implementation of sharding on the NEAR Protocol blockchain has been a primary driver of its recent success. Additionally, NEAR registered a 42% increase in daily transactions and a 30.8% surge in newly created NEAR wallets between August 25 and September 24.

NEAR's price has been up 27.10% in the last seven days to $5.55, with a predicted price rally ahead of the incoming bull market. The protocol's fundamentals are solid, making it an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors.

    <p>Solana  price may experience a 10% pullback before market greed peaks, according to BeInCrypto. Additionally, Solana is expected to surpass $300 as it pumps, with experts predicting that Solana fees will match or even surpass those of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency's rally started last week following the US Federal Reserve's rate cuts, pushing its price above the $140 resistance level and turning it into support. Solana broke above a key resistance level on Friday, fuelling bullish sentiment that reignited over a week ago. Analysts believe reclaiming this mark would propel the price toward the next key resistance level, potentially breaking out toward the $200 resistance level.</p>

    <p>DOGE has flashed a sell signal on its daily charts, sparking questions about whether it can reach $1 or if that's an unattainable goal. Despite this, some analysts predict a potential 100% rally next for Dogecoin, citing various indicators. Trading volume for DOGE has increased by 50% to over $1.5 billion, and its price has risen 18.8% on a weekly chart. Some investors are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market and may find it with a cheap DOGE alternative, which has a price under $0.0010 and is ready to skyrocket. Dogecoin's price has risen 16% in one week due to Elon Musk's support, sparking a market rally among investors. However, Rollblock's revenue share model offers a more sustainable passive income than DOGE and Litecoin, ensuring steady returns.</p>
